alsa-utils (1.0.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This upload removes alsaconf and asoundconf, two scripts which
  could be used to modify certain ALSA parametres, as they caused
  more problems than provided solutions, were outdated and generally
  useless.

  alsaconf was upstream's way to detect sound cards and generate
  system-wide ALSA configurations. However, this should have been
  unnecessary for a very long time, with the introduction of udev
  support and its automatic hardware detection. If this isn't the
  case for you, it's a bug which should be filed and fixed properly.

  asoundconf was a tool introduced by Ubuntu which could be used to
  generate asoundrc files for systems with special needs. The script
  was not being maintained and was getting buggy, and the Debian and
  Ubuntu teams have agreed to get rid of it for the next release. Users
  can use Pulse or similar technologies to configure their preferred
  sound devices and sinks.
