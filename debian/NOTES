                     MAINTAINER NOTES
                     for alsa-utils


TODO when someone has time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/etc/init.d/alsa-utils should be changed so that instead of doing a
mere "alsactl restore" it takes the following steps in the "start" method:

     Move old asound.state to asound.state_PREV
     Run "alsactl store" to create new asound.state
     Run asound.state through a processor which sets "sane"
       default values without changing the structure of the file
     Use the values in asound.state_PREV to update the values in
       the new asound.state without changing the structure of
       the file
     Run "alsactl restore"

This would run faster than the current code and might deal better with
driver upgrades.

Setting default mixer levels
----------------------------
Mandriva takes an interesting approch to resetting mixer levels.
    http://cvs.mandriva.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/soft/sound-scripts/
Its reset_sound script does:
    * alsactl store to file
    * process file with perl script alsa_default.pl
    * alsactl restore from file
We should consider taking this code which appears to be much
smarter than our sanify_levels_on_card().

Some controls need to be set differently on different machines.
* External Amplifier
  + Need it on:

  + Need it off:

    http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15099
* Audigy Analog/Digital Output Jack
These should be set to appropriate defaults in the driver and not
touched by our initscript.
